<h1 style="font-weight: bolder; text-align: center;">Things I Did Over The Summer</h1>
<p class="p_one">Over the last year, I have done many things including work and a really fun vacation.</p>
<img src="img/">
<p class="p_two">At the end of last school year, I decided to get a job. I applied to Shake Shack and got a job there and have been working there ever since.

<p class="p_three">I finally got my lisence last spring and I can drive to work now, so thats cool. Unfortunately I still don't have a car</p> 
<img src="">
<p class="p_four"> It's a lot of fun working there because I have friends that also decided to work there so it feels more like a hang out rather than a job.

<p class="p_five">More recently, I went on vacation at the end of august to see my family in colorado. I was a really good time and I got to eat some great mexican food. I also got to learn how to drive a manual transmission.</p>
<img src="">
<p class="p_six">Last school year I had also made the decision to stop playing basketball officially. I still play during my free time and with friends, but I feel too overwhelmed with college to risk wasting my time.</p>
